      i work as a backend engineer at my current jobs, building and deploying microservices & APIs. 
      i have experience working in agile environments, and have worked on a variety of projects, from simple features to leading product development.
      as a software engineer, i thrive & enjoy learning new technologies & also taking initiatives. my goal is to always build applications that are scalable
      and efficient.

      <strong>when i'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, i'm probably getting lost & finding my way back home from an evening stroll, reading a book, or 
      feeding off my existential dread.
